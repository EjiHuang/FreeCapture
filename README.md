FreeCapture
===========

Free-form selection desktop image capturing.

Select an area on your desktop - across any or all screens - using a "lasso" like selection method. 
Images by nature are rectangular, but anything outside of the selection will be transparent,
creating an image that appears to be in the shape of the selection made.
